Greetings and welcome to my first ever **README** file. I'm very exited to present it to you. This process has been frustrating but rewarding in its own way too.

In this project I'm learning how to create repositories and commit changes to them through the command line. Here's a breakdown of what I did:
*Set up repository
*Initialized git
*Added the remote origin
*And now I'm creating the README file!

Fun times over here!
